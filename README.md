Lifty
=====

Lifty is part of the [Lifty project](http://lifty.org "Lifty project").

Lifty is a [SBT processor](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Processors "SBT processor") for generating files associated with the Lift framework. This was developed as part of my Google Summer of Code 2010 project. It's using a framework that I created, see: [Lifty Engine](http://github.com/Lifty/Lifty-engine/ "Lifty Engine").

For more information check out it's [Github page](http://lifty.github.com/Lifty/ "Github page").
